# Great Barrier Reef Coral Skeletal Records Database (GBRCD)
A database collecting coral skeletal records from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Database gathers records that include geochemical or luminescence measurements and can be found at NOAA WDS (https://doi.org/10.25921/hqxk-8h74) & lipdverse (https://lipdverse.org/GBRCD/current_version/).

The GBRCD is available as a CSV version (CSV metadata and files) or a LiPD version (files or serialisation).

A description of the database is found in the database description paper available here: coming soon

A selection of code for handling the database is available here on the databases GitHub.

The GBRCD only includes records with proxy measurements from coral skeletons (i.e. geochemical analysis, luminescence), but will archive additional measurements for a coral record alongside target data if it uses the same age model (resolution and time points). 

The GBRCD accepts both published and unpublished records from GBR corals that include:
* corals from GBR locations (and Flinders Reef due to its regional context and latitudinal relevance). 
* multi-year (continuous) measurements from coral skeletons. 
* an age model. Each record needs to include relevant chronology.

**Please email GBR coral records to be archived in the GBRCD to: GBRCDsubmissions [at] outlook [dot] com**

When submitting published records to the GBRCD team, please provide links to the relevant publication(s). If there is additional information available that is suitable to complete GBRCD metadata fields, which was not included in the publication (e.g. coral ID, IGSN, collection info (such as time and elevation/depth), method of data measurement and method analytical precision/error, age model method, diagenesis screening method(s), etc.), please provide this information alongside the submitted data.

When submitting new/not previously published records, please provide all available relevant information required to complete the GBRCD metadata fields.
