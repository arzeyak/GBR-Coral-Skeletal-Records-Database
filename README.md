# Great Barrier Reef Coral Skeletal Records Database (GBRCD)
A database collecting coral skeletal records from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Database gathers records that include geochemical or luminescence measurements and can be found at ... & https://lipdverse.org/GBRCD/current_version/.

A selection of code for handling the database is available here.

The GBRCD only includes records with proxy measurements from coral skeletons (i.e. geochemical analysis, luminescence), but will archive additional measurements for a coral records alongside target data if it uses the same age model (resolution and time points). 

The GBRCD accepts both published and unpublished records from GBR corals that include:
* corals from GBR locations (and Flinders Reef due to its regional context and latitudinal relevance). 
* multi-year (continuous) measurements from coral skeletons. 
* an age model. Each record needed to include relevant chronology.
